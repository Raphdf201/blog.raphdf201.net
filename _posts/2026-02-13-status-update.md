## Status update

I kinda forgot about this blog for a while. Since the last post, the uploads api has been moved to uploads.raphdf201.net, I have a matrix server at matrix.raphdf201.net and I have docs for shapez 2 at shapez2.raphdf201.net and a mod project generator at generator.shapez2.raphdf201.net.

I am now migrating most of my code to my forgejo, due to the recent GitHub outages and bugs, I will keep mirrors on GitHub and potentially Gitlab/Codeberg for big projects.

After my exams, in June, I will start working on a multiplayer mod for shapez 2. I already made some prototypes to ensure it is possible, and I am pretty confident that I will be able to work this out.

I also intend to get a 3rd server and reorganize my stuff, since it is a bit messy rn.
